# ADR Format

ADRs live in `specs/architecture/decisions/` and use the naming convention: `adr-NNNN-slug.md`.

Scan `specs/architecture/decisions/` for the highest existing number and increment by one.

## Template

```md
# {Short title of the decision}

**Status:** Accepted

{Explanation: what's the context, what did we decide, and why. This can be a single paragraph or several. The value is in recording _that_ a decision was made and _why_ — not in filling out sections.}

## Considered Options

- **Option A** — Why it was rejected or why it wasn't suitable.
- **Option B** — Another alternative and its trade-offs.
```

## Required

- **Status** — One of: `Proposed`, `Accepted`, `Deprecated`, `Superseded by ADR-NNNN`.
- **Explanation** — Why this decision was made. Can be terse.

## Optional sections

Only include these when they add genuine value:

- **Considered Options** — When there were real alternatives worth remembering (to prevent someone from suggesting them again in six months).
- **Consequences** — When non-obvious downstream effects need to be called out.

## When to offer an ADR

All three of these must be true:

1. **Hard to reverse** — the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context** — a future reader will look at the code and wonder "why on earth did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off** — there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

If a decision is easy to reverse, skip it — you'll just reverse it. If it's not surprising, nobody will wonder why. If there was no real alternative, there's nothing to record beyond "we did the obvious thing."

### What qualifies

- **Architectural shape.** "We're using a monorepo." "The write model is event-sourced, the read model is projected into Postgres."
- **Integration patterns between contexts.** "Ordering and Billing communicate via domain events, not synchronous HTTP."
- **Technology choices that carry lock-in.** Database, message bus, auth provider, deployment target. Not every library — just the ones that would take a quarter to swap out.
- **Boundary and scope decisions.** "Customer data is owned by the Customer context; other contexts reference it by ID only." The explicit no-s are as valuable as the yes-s.
- **Deliberate deviations from the obvious path.** "We're using manual SQL instead of an ORM because X." Anything where a reasonable reader would assume the opposite.
- **Constraints not visible in the code.** "We can't use AWS because of compliance requirements." "Response times must be under 200ms because of the partner API contract."
- **Rejected alternatives when the rejection is non-obvious.** If you considered GraphQL and picked REST for subtle reasons, record it — otherwise someone will suggest GraphQL again in six months.

## After creating an ADR

Register it in the Decision Index of `specs/index.md`:

```md
| [ADR-NNNN](architecture/decisions/adr-NNNN-slug.md) | Title | Status |
```
